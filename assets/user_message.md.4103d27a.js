You can find messages easily with the prefined categories grouped by business flow functional source. This page describes how ExportRim classifies the categories, explains the different sources, and provides some examples of the messaging flow.</p><p>Each message starts with a thread, which will be followed by chats, to allow the focus on one subject. Threads can be created manually or generated by the system. The participants for the thread can use the chat box to correspond. This thread messaging is designed to organize communication and enhance productivity. Every thread is grouped under a correspondence category as per the table below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>General Topics</td><td>For general correspondences</td></tr><tr><td>Business Inquiries</td><td>Inquiries from directory listing and catalog</td></tr><tr><td>Business Orders</td><td>Correspondences on sales and purchase orders</td></tr><tr><td>Service Inquiries</td><td>Inquiries for packaged and partner services</td></tr><tr><td>Service Requests</td><td>Requests for service quotes</td></tr><tr><td>Service Projects</td><td>Correspondences on service orders</td></tr></tbody></table><p>General Topics are usually messages created manually by the sender. Examples include feedback, questions, requests for clarification, and greetings.</p><p>Business Inquiries include all inquiries from your company inquiry form, catalog item inquiry form, and replies to your tradehub postings. For example, when a prospect views your company and likes to request more information, the prospect can send you an inquiry directly using the inquiry form. The system will create a message thread for both the prospect (sender) and you (recipient) to communicate on.</p><p>Business Orders should be used specifically for order-related communication. For example, if you send a purchase order, you create one thread for that specific purchase order. This will help you to track all discussions, queries, and follow-ups for that order. Once an order is completed, you can mark the thread ‘closed’ to help you focus on open threads.</p><p>Service Inquiries are generated when you send inquiries for any ExportRim services, which include packaged services, partner services, and managed services. ExportRim staff and partners will reply to the thread directly.</p><p>Service Requests are generated when you request quotes from ExportRim partners. The partner will respond to your thread for details and also provide a quote. You can use this thread to continue all discussions until you accept and pay for the quote. Once you have paid for the quote, the system will initiate a service project. If you decide to decline the quote, the system will close this service request.</p><p>Service Projects are used for communications on a service order you have accepted as described above. You should use this thread to track all discussions on the project until it is completed. Once the project is completed, the system will close this thread.</p><p>Select <strong>Messaging &gt; Messages</strong> from the administration sidebar.</p><h2 id="create-new-thread" tabindex="-1">Create New Thread <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-new-thread" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Click the [Add] icon on the top right.</p><p>Enter the required information and press <strong>Send</strong>.</p><h2 id="read-reply-thread" tabindex="-1">Read/Reply Thread <a class="header-anchor" href="#read-reply-thread" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Select and click a thread from the list.
