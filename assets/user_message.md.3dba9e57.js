You can find messages easily with the prefined categories grouped by business flow functional source. This page describes how ExportRim classifies the categories, explains the different sources, and provides some examples of the messaging flow.</p><p>Each message starts with a thread, which will be followed by chats, to allow the focus on one subject. Threads can be created manually or generated by the system. The participants for the thread can use the chat box to correspond. This thread messaging is designed to organize communication and enhance productivity. Every thread is grouped under a correspondence category as per the table below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>General</td><td>For general correspondences</td></tr><tr><td>Company</td><td>Inquiries from directory listing, catalog and tradehub</td></tr><tr><td>Service</td><td>Communication on service requests and orders</td></tr></tbody></table><p>General are usually messages created manually by the sender. Examples include feedback, questions, requests for clarification, and greetings.</p><p>Company include all inquiries from your company inquiry form, catalog item inquiry form, and replies to your tradehub postings. For example, when a prospect views your company and likes to request more information, the prospect can send you an inquiry directly using the inquiry form. The system will create a message thread for both the prospect (sender) and you (recipient) to communicate on.</p><p>Service includes all correspondences relating to service requests (RFQ) and service orders. A thread is generated for each specific RFQ and order when you initiate a communication via the <strong>Chat</strong> icon for the RFQ or order. You can continue to communicate on the thread via this message center, service request or service order.</p><p>Select <strong>Messaging &gt; Messages</strong> from the administration sidebar.</p><h2 id="create-new-thread" tabindex="-1">Create New Thread <a class="header-anchor" href="#create-new-thread" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Click the [Add] icon on the top right.</p><p>Enter the required information and press <strong>Send</strong>.</p><h2 id="read-reply-thread" tabindex="-1">Read/Reply Thread <a class="header-anchor" href="#read-reply-thread" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Select and click a thread from the list.
